######### HOW TO USE ########
# rename makemod.txt to makemod.py, copy the wanted music files in ogg
# format into the music folder with the .py file and then double click
# the makemod.py. Needs Python installed!

# get list of files in WD

# filter list -> we need filetype files
songs = fnmatch.filter(files, '*.' + filetype)

# listdir does not return a sorted list
# but having the songs sorted will make life easier
songs.sort()

# remove filetype
songs = [os.path.splitext(i)[0] for i in songs]

##### create asset file
with open('music.asset', 'w') as asset:
    for i in songs:
        asset.write(asset_template.format(song = i))

#### create songs.txt
with open('songs.txt', 'w') as songtxt:
    for i in songs:
        songtxt.write(song_template.format(song = i))
